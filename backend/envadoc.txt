### **Setting Up & Activating a Virtual Environment in Windows (VS Code)**
Follow these steps to create and activate a virtual environment in **VS Code** on **Windows**:

---

### **1️⃣ Open VS Code and Your Project Folder**
- Open **VS Code**.
- Click on **File > Open Folder** and select your project folder.

---

### **2️⃣ Open the Terminal in VS Code**
- Press **`Ctrl + ~`** (tilde key) to open the terminal.
- Make sure you're in your project directory:
  ```sh
  cd path\to\your\project
  ```

---

### **3️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment**
Run the following command to create a **virtual environment** named `venv`:
```sh
python -m venv venv
```

---

### **4️⃣ Activate the Virtual Environment**
Now, activate the virtual environment:

✅ **For Windows (Command Prompt in VS Code):**
```sh
venv\Scripts\activate
```

✅ **For Windows (PowerShell in VS Code):**
```sh
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
⚠️ If you get an error saying _"execution policy prevents running scripts"_, run this command in PowerShell:
```sh
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
```
Then, try activating it again.

---

### **5️⃣ Confirm Virtual Environment Activation**
Once activated, your terminal should show `(venv)` before the command prompt:
```
(venv) C:\path\to\your\project>
```

---

### **6️⃣ Install Required Libraries**
After activating the virtual environment, install the necessary dependencies:
```sh
pip install flask flask_pymongo flask_cors
```
To install from a `requirements.txt` file (if available):
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **7️⃣ Run Your Flask App**
Run your Flask app inside the virtual environment:
```sh
python app.py
```
or
```sh
flask run
```

---

### **8️⃣ Deactivate the Virtual Environment**
When you're done, deactivate it with:
```sh
deactivate
```

---

🚀 **Now, your Flask project is running in a virtual environment inside VS Code!** 🚀
